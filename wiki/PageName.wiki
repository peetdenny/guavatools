Failed to get operation name from the incoming request
<h4 id="section-FailedOperationName-Description">Description</h4>
The name of the operation doesn't match any operation of the target
service. Usually means a mismatch between the wsdl of the Proxy and the
wsdl of the target service, either the name of the operation or its
namespace. If so, change one of the wsdls, or produce a transformation
within the proxy.
