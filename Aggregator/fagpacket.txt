This is as yet unproven



BatchMetaData
	Describes the current state of a batch based on the JMS message headers: correlationId, batchSize, positionInBatch
	has a method to indicate when the batch is ready for collection

QueuePoller
	Polls queue every n seconds and builds a collection of BatchMetaData objects
	Then hands that to the BatchProcessOrchestrator

BatchProcessOrchestrator
	Accepts incoming BatchMetaData collections from the MessageBrowser and hands individual BatchMetaData to a BatchProcessor once the batch indicates it
	is ready for processing,
	creates it if necessary. Removes completed BatchProcessors from the store
	
BatchProcessor
	Created with a specific correlationId, queries the first message it finds
	
BatchProcessorFactory
	Creates batchProcessors and injects them with JMS resources (Queues, Topics what have you)
